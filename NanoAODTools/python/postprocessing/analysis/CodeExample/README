macros:
MT2W and tMod calculation, one example is provided in example.cc

MT2w calculation is done using the code from arXiv1203.4813 provided: 
https://sites.google.com/a/ucdavis.edu/mass/
we added the selection of the candidates using the b-tag information:
JetUtil.h/.cc contains the selection of jets used for the MT2W and tMod calculation
mt2w_bisect.h/.cpp contains the calculation of MT2W, with mt2w.h/ccc being helper functions
topness.h/.cc contains the calcuation of the (modified) topness variables.

To run the example,
compile with make

$ make
$ ./example



Electronic limit material:
The file
ElectronicLimitsSUS16028.root
contains electronic versions of all limit curves.

The TH2F histograms denote the expected and observed upper limit on the signal cross section at 95% CL.
The TGraphs contain the displayed limit curves:
gExpLimit is the expected limit curve, gObsLimit the observed limit curves.
TGraphs with *minus1sigma*/*plus1sigma* contain the 1 sigma uncertainty variations.
T2tt denotes the signature of top squark --> top quark + neutralino, while T2bW denotes the topology of top squark --> b quark + chargino, chargino --> W boson + neutralino.
